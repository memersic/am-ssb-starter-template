The page title above is technically an 'h1' header, with the addition of a light-grey horizontal line (or `</hr>`).  
Therefore it's recommended that you start with an 'h2' header in your page's body content.

## This is a 'heading 2'

 - This is regular body text
 - **This is regular BOLD text**
 - *This is regular italic text*
 - <u>This text is underlined using HTML tags</u>

To 'center' text, you can use the HTML tags `<center>` and `</center>` on either side of the text you want center-justified.

See example below:  
<center>***This text is center-justified on the page!***</center>

### This is a 'heading 3'

This is an un-ordered list:

* List item one
* List item two
* List item three

This is an ordered list:  

1. List item one
2. List item two
3. List item three  

#### This is a heading 4

This section will demonstrate the use of `"inline" code samples`, as well as full 'code-blocks' shown below.

* To create 'inline' code samples, simply surround the word or phrase with single back-ticks, `as shown here`.  
* To create a full code-block, begin a new line with triple back-ticks, and follow-up your code-block with triple back-ticks again as shown below:
